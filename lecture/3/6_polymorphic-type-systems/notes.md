# Motivation

- Adding new types is really annoying in a monomorphic type system
- Can't express things like generics or containers elegantly
  
Polymorphism lets us abstract over types and get more powerful code.

## Syntax

`Tycon(`$\mu$`)` and `Conapp(`$\tau$, `[`$\tau_1, ..., \tau_n$`])`helps us do some more modularity
